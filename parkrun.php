                            taking first position and Lucy Roberts second lady on her parkrun debut 
                            at the free-to-enter 5km timed run at Sconce and Devon Park. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Third after the opening half kilometer, Matthew moved into second halfway round 
                            the first of three laps and shortly thereafter took the lead and eased out a gap 
                            on the chasing runners. Running comfortably to the finish, Matthew equalled his 
                            course PB of 18:16, eighteen seconds clear of second placed Tomas Tresnak.

                            stages of the run. He slipped to sixth by the finish, but after a typically spirited run, 
                            was pleased to clock 21:54. He was followed in tenth position by Rob McArdle, who celebrated 
                            his second highest finish at Newark parkrun and his third fastest time with 22:59.

                            just 21 seconds behind first lady Janet Davies. The fifth Grantham Running Club runner to
