                                        Grantham Running Club A Team were thrilled to finish second in their category and fourth overall at 
                                        Equinox 24, a 24 hour endurance race held on the Belvoir Castle Estate over the weekend of the 20th 
                                        and 21st September. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Although only its second year, Equinox 24 has already established itself as one of the countryâ€™s most popular endurance events. 
                                        Competitors try to complete as many laps of the approximately 10km multi-terrain course as possible from Midday on the Saturday 
                                        through to Midday on the Sunday. Entrants could choose whether to compete solo, or as pairs, or small or large teams. Grantham 
                                        Running Club entered two large mixed sex teams, each comprising eight runners.

                                        Conditions were initially good for the early laps of the race, but those running through the night were 
                                        hampered initially by rain and then by mist, with only head torches to help navigate through the darkness. 
                                        Thankfully come dawn the mist cleared and runners enjoyed a sunny conclusion to the race.

                                        Grantham Running Club A Team, comprising: Jeremy Page; Stuart Sinclair; Mark Wilson; Gerry Hyde; Rob Howbrook; 
                                        Matthew Kingston-Lee; Holly Durham; and Ben Mason, overcame the challenging course and night time conditions, 
                                        sleep deprivation, numerous injuries, and general fatigue to complete 33 laps (approximately 190 miles), finishing 
                                        second in the Large Team Category behind overall winners Stilton Striders Team A, who amassed an impressive 35 laps.
