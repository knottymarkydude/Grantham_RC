                                    For your own safety we ask that you refrain from using MP3 players or earphones, the Race Referee 
                                    retains the right to disqualify runners who ignore this request. Runners will be required to run in 
                                    accordance with the Highway Code and in single file wherever possible.  It is a fairly flat course with 
                                    33m of ascent and 33m of descent, a course profile is on our website.  There is one drinks station for 
                                    water at 6km. There is also a first aid station here as well as one just before the finish. If you witness a fellow runner 
                                    injured, or in difficulty, please make sure a marshal has been informed before you continue your run. 
                                </p>

                                    until the road closure is put in place at 7:05pm.  Runners who get to the start 
                                    prior to this time are requested not to block the road and to assemble in the car park adjacent.  
                                    To help ensure a smooth start we will indicate time boxes at the roadside.

                                    you will be guided onto the nearside carriageway only.  Runners are reminded to run on the left 
                                    hand side throughout the race.   This is for your own safety and is the shortest route round the
